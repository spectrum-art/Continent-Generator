Buttons,,Generate; Reroll; Randomize; Reset; Save as PNG,,,,,Primary user actions. Generate runs the current parameters. Reroll keeps parameters but generates a new seed. Randomize changes parameters but keeps the seed. Reset returns all parameters to defaults. Save exports a high-resolution PNG of the current map.
Buttons,X,Import; Export,,,,,Advanced sharing tools. Export produces a compact string representing seed and parameters. Import restores a map from such a string.
Seed,,Text box,Str,,,Autogenerated,Human-readable seed in AdjectiveNoun format. User can type custom seeds. Used as the deterministic root for all procedural generation.
Preset,,Earth-like; Archipelago; Mountain Kingdoms; Riverlands; Dune World; Rain World; Broken Coast,,,,Earth-like,High-level parameter presets. Adjusts multiple sliders at once to create recognizable continent styles.
Size,,Isle (50k mi²); Region (500k mi²); Subcontinent (5m mi²); Supercontinent (20m mi²),,,,Region (500k mi²),Defines total map area including water. Determines generation resolution + default zoom + number of plates.
Aspect Ratio,,Wide (2:1); Landscape (3:2); Square (1:1); Portrait (2:3); Narrow (1:2),,,,Landscape (3:2),Defines canvas proportions. All map sizes must tile cleanly into these ratios.
Land Fraction,,Slider,Int,1,10,5,Controls the proportion of land vs ocean. Lower values produce mostly ocean with islands; higher values produce large landmasses.
Relief,,Slider,Int,1,10,6,Controls overall elevation variance. Higher values produce taller mountains and deeper basins.
Fragmentation,,Slider,Int,1,10,4,Controls how broken up the landmass is. Higher values produce archipelagos and inland seas.
Coastal Smoothing,,Slider,Int,1,10,6,Controls coastline roundness. Low values produce jagged complex coasts. High values produce smooth rounded continents.
Latitude Center,X,Slider,Int,-70,70,50,Sets the central latitude of the map’s climate band. Influences temperature and biome distribution.
Latitude Span,X,Slider,Int,20,180,45,Defines how much of the globe’s latitude range is represented. Smaller values create uniform climates; larger values create polar-to-tropical transitions.
Plate Count,X,Fewer; Normal; More,Int,-1,1,0,Adjusts the number of tectonic plates relative to map size. Influences mountain chain frequency and continental structure.
Mountain Peakiness,X,Slider,Int,1,10,5,Controls how sharp and dramatic mountain ranges appear. Higher values create spikier more dramatic ridges.
Climate Bias,X,Slider,Int,-5,5,0,Shifts overall climate toward wetter or drier conditions. Negative values favor deserts; positive values favor forests and wetlands.
Island Density,X,Slider,Int,0,10,4,Controls the frequency of offshore islands and archipelagos.
Biome mix,,Less → More,,,,,Soft target weights for biome distribution. Sliders influence relative prevalence but final placement is determined by climate and terrain.
-- Rivers,,Slider,Float,0,1,0.6,Controls density of river systems. Higher values produce more tributaries and branching networks.
-- Grassland,,Slider,Float,0,1,1,Soft target for open grassland and plains.
-- Temperate Forest,,Slider,Float,0,1,1,Soft target for mid-latitude deciduous or mixed forests.
-- Rainforest,,Slider,Float,0,1,0.5,Soft target for high-moisture tropical forests.
-- Desert,,Slider,Float,0,1,0.6,Soft target for arid and semi-arid regions.
-- Mountains,,Slider,Float,0,1,0.7,Soft target for mountainous terrain coverage.
-- Tundra,,Slider,Float,0,1,0.3,Soft target for cold or high-altitude regions.
Buttons,,Reset Biome Mix; Toggle Advanced Mode,,,,,Reset restores biome sliders to defaults. Advanced Mode reveals advanced controls like latitude + plates + climate bias.
